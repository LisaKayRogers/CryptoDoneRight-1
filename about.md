<h3>Methods:</h3>
<strong>1. Demystifying Cryptography:</strong> <br />
Cryptography is a complicated subject. What makes it complicated to consumers are the plethora of options (in terms of configuration and deployment) that exist to achieve most up-to-date and proven security. Everyday use of cryptography for the majority of professionals does not necessitate understanding the intricate details of the various flavors available. Through Crypto Done Right, we aim to deliver content to our audience in the a clear and coherent fashion.  <br /> <br />

<strong>2. Organized, Easy-to-Navigate Content:</strong> <br />
Cryptography is often seen as inaccessible due to poor and unorganized documentation. Crypto Done Right aims to set a standard template around key content to help the audience become familiar with the structure of the website. After a few clicks around, you should find the website very easy to navigate.  <br /> <br />

<strong>3. Community Driven: </strong> <br />
The website will use a centralized database where anyone can come in and contribute content. The content will be automatically rendered according to the standard templates to maintain a consistent overall feel. <br />
